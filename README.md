## contributing

We could use your help maintaining and growing the tracespace ecosystem! Issues and pull requests are greatly appreciated.

### development setup

The tracespace tools live here in this [monorepo][]. We use [lerna][] to manage this setup.

Node v8 (lts/carbon) or later is recommended.

```shell
# clone repository and install dependencies
git clone git@github.com:tracespace/tracespace.git
cd tracespace
npm install
```

This repository adheres to the [Conventional Changelog][conventional-changelog] commit specification for automatic changelog generation. We recommend installing [commitizen][commitizen] to ensure your commit messages are properly formatted:

```shell
npm install -g commitizen

# later, when you're ready to commit
git add some/files/*
git cz
```

All development scripts below **should be run from the root of the repository**. Lerna handles delegating scripts downwards to the individual projects as necessary.

[monorepo]: https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md
[lerna]: https://lernajs.io/
[conventional-changelog]: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog
[commitizen]: https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/

### tests

Automated tests consist of unit tests along with integration [snapshot tests][snapshot-testing] of SVG and data outputs.

```shell
# run unit and integration tests tests with coverage
npm test

# set SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 to update integration test snapshots
SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 npm test

# run unit tests in watch mode (no coverage)
npm run test:watch

# set INTEGRATION=1 to also include integration tests
INTEGRATION=1 npm run test:watch
```

[snapshot-testing]: https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html

### development servers

`pcb-stackup`, `pcb-stackup-core`, `gerber-to-svg`, and `@tracespace/view` have development servers. The first three serve a set of reference renders for manual visual inspection, and the `@tracespace/view` development server builds and serves the web-app locally.

```shell
# run all dev servers
npm run start

# run server for a specific project
npm run start -- --scope @tracespace/view
```

### production assets

There are two production asset types that you can build:

- Full web-app bundles
  - `@tracespace/view`
- Standalone library bundles
  - `gerber-parser`
  - `gerber-plotter`
  - `gerber-to-svg`
  - `pcb-stackup-core`
  - `pcb-stackup`
  - `whats-that-gerber`

To build them:

```shell
# build production bundles
npm run build

# build:all
# builds all production bundles, example files, and documentation
npm run build:all

# build all bundles and serve them for testing/validation
npm run serve

# as with the dev server, these commands may be scoped by name
npm run build -- --scope gerber-parser
npm run serve -- --scope @tracespace/view
```

### linting and formatting

```shell
# format the code for styling
npm run format

# lint the code for potential errors
npm run lint

# typecheck any typescript code
npm run check
```

### publishing

Packages are published to npm by the CI server. To publish a release, you must have write access to the repository. There is a `bump` script in the `package.json` that will:

- Run all tests
- Write new version to `package.json` in updated packages
- Generate / update the changelogs
- Commit, tag, and push to git

First, checkout and pull down the latest commits on `master`:

```shell
git checkout master
get pull origin master
```

Then, bump the version:

```shell
# by default, bump to the next version as determined by conventional commits
npm run bump

# you may specify a bump level or exact version
# prerelease bumps will be prefixed with "next", e.g. 4.0.0 -> 4.0.1-next.0
# https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/version#readme
npm run bump -- ${major|minor|patch|premajor|preminor|prepatch|prerelease}
npm run bump -- v42.0.0

# to do a "dry run", you can stop before commit and tag
npm run bump -- --no-git-tag-version
```

After you bump, push the commit and tag:

```shell
git push origin master --follow-tags
```

The release will be published to the `latest` npm tag for bare versions (e.g. `4.0.0`) and to `next` for pre-release versions (e.g. `4.0.0-next.0`).
